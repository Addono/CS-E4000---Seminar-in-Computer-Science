	abstract = {In line with cloud computing emergence as the dominant enterprise computing paradigm, our conceptualization of the cloud computing reference architecture and service construction has also evolved. For example, to address the need for cost reduction and rapid provisioning, virtualization has moved beyond hardware to containers. More recently, serverless computing or Function-as-a-Service has been presented as a means to introduce further cost-efficiencies, reduce configuration and management overheads, and rapidly increase an application’s ability to speed up, scale up and scale down in the cloud. The potential of this new computation model is reflected in the introduction of serverless computing platforms by the main hyperscale cloud service providers. This paper provides an overview and multi-level feature analysis of seven enterprise serverless computing platforms. It reviews extant research on these platforms and identifies the emergence of AWS Lambda as a de facto base platform for research on enterprise serverless cloud computing. The paper concludes with a summary of avenues for further research.},

Although cloud computing provides virtually unlimited computational resources, low-latency applications cannot aﬀord the high latencies introduced by sending and retrieving data from/to the cloud. In this scenario, edge computing appears as a promising solution by bringing computation and data near to users and devices. However, the resource-ﬁnite nature of edge servers constrains the possibility of deploying full applications on them. To cope with these problems, we propose a serverless architecture at the edge, bringing a highly scalable, intelligent and cost-eﬀective use of edge infrastructure’s resources with minimal conﬁguration and operation eﬀorts. The feasibility of our approach is shown through an augmented reality use case for mobile devices, in which we oﬄoad computation and data intensive tasks from the devices to serverless functions at the edge, outperforming the cloud alternative up to 80\% in terms of throughput and latency.},

At the same time, such devices often enjoy strong connectivity with more powerful machines ranging from laptops and desktops to commercial clouds. This paper presents the design and implementation of CloneCloud, a system that automatically transforms mobile applications to beneﬁt from the cloud. The system is a ﬂexible application partitioner and execution runtime that enables unmodiﬁed mobile applications running in an application-level virtual machine to seamlessly off-load part of their execution from mobile devices onto device clones operating in a computational cloud. CloneCloud uses a combination of static analysis and dynamic proﬁling to partition applications automatically at a ﬁne granularity while optimizing execution time and energy use for a target computation and communication environment. At runtime, the application partitioning is effected by migrating a thread from the mobile device at a chosen point to the clone in the cloud, executing there for the remainder of the partition, and re-integrating the migrated thread back to the mobile device. Our evaluation shows that CloneCloud can adapt application partitioning to different environments, and can help some applications achieve as much as a 20x execution speed-up and a 20-fold decrease of energy spent on the mobile device.},

	abstract = {In the Internet of Things (IoT) era, with ubiquitous remote sensing devices and other diverse data sources, nearly everything can forward voluminous data continuously, in realtime, which drives demand to perform real-time analytics on uninterrupted IoT data flows. The typical resultant approach is a cloud-centered architecture providing an analytic service for real-time IoT data processing. However, a cloud-centered IoT analytic service cannot guarantee real-time responsiveness has a high-fee pay-as-you-go business model, and opens data privacy concerns. Hence, it becomes rational to shift analytic workloads to the edge and provide a management service for edge analysis. Existing work on providing edge analytics as a service encountered challenges such as lacking a lightweight way to compose IoT applications based on multiple service providers, lacking a flexible and unified way to define domainspecific analytic logic, and maintaining efficiency when processing data on a resource-limited edge. This paper presents EAaaS, a scalable analytic service for enabling realtime edge analytics in IoT scenarios. In this work, we propose a unified rule-based analytic model to ease user's programming efforts in specifying rule-based analytic logic. Moreover, we also designed and implemented a high performance edge engine to apply rule-based analytic on incoming device data streams. To simplify the access to EAaaS service, a group of RESTful web interfaces is also designed for edge analytic management on cloud and flexible composition with external services. EAaaS is implemented as a part of IBM Watson IoT Platform, which is a cloud service for elementary IoT application development on IBM Bluemix cloud announced by IBM recently. We have conducted proof of correctness (PoC) of EAaaS with customers from boat racing in the U.S. and collected valuable feedback from customers for further enhancement of EAaaS’s flexibility and usability.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in virtualization and software architecture have led to the new paradigm of serverless computing, which allows developers to deploy applications as stateless functions without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Accordingly, a serverless platform handles the lifecycle, execution and scaling of the actual functions; these need to run only when invoked or triggered by an event. Thus, the major beneﬁts of serverless computing are low operational concerns and efﬁcient resource management and utilization. Serverless computing is currently offered by several public cloud service providers. However, there are certain limitations on the public cloud platforms, such as vendor lock-in and restrictions on the computation of the functions. Open source serverless frameworks are a promising solution to avoid these limitations and bring the power of serverless computing to on-premise deployments. However, these frameworks have not been evaluated before. Thus, we carry out a comprehensive feature comparison of popular open source serverless computing frameworks. We then evaluate the performance of selected frameworks: Fission, Kubeless and OpenFaaS. Speciﬁcally, we characterize the response time and ratio of successfully received responses under different loads and provide insights into the design choices of each framework.},

Yet, despite the excitement about the potential of fog computing, few comprehensive quantitative characteristics of the properties of fog computing architectures have been conducted. In this paper we examine the properties of task completion latencies in fog computing. First, we present the results of our empirical benchmarking-based study of task completion latencies. The study covered a range of settings, and uniquely considered both traditional and serverless fog computing execution points. It demonstrated the range of execution point characteristics in different locations and the relative stability of latency characteristics for a given location. It also highlighted properties of serverless execution that are not incorporated in existing fog computing algorithms. Second, we present a framework we developed for co-optimizing task completion quality and latency, which was inspired by the insights of our empirical study. We describe fog computing task assignment problems we formulated under this framework, and present the algorithms we developed for solving them.},

	abstract = {The emerging trend of edge computing has led several cloud providers to release their own platforms for performing computation at the 'edge' of the network. We compare two such platforms, Amazon AWS Greengrass and Microsoft Azure IoT Edge, using a new benchmark comprising a suite of performance metrics. We also compare the performance of the edge frameworks to cloud-only implementations available in their respective cloud ecosystems. Amazon AWS Greengrass and Azure IoT Edge use different underlying technologies, edge Lambda functions vs. containers, and so we also elaborate on platform features available to developers. Our study shows that both of these edge platforms provide comparable performance, which nevertheless differs in important ways for key types of workloads used in edge applications. Finally, we discuss several current issues and challenges we faced in deploying these platforms.},
