	abstract = {In line with cloud computing emergence as the dominant enterprise computing paradigm, our conceptualization of the cloud computing reference architecture and service construction has also evolved. For example, to address the need for cost reduction and rapid provisioning, virtualization has moved beyond hardware to containers. More recently, serverless computing or Function-as-a-Service has been presented as a means to introduce further cost-efficiencies, reduce configuration and management overheads, and rapidly increase an application’s ability to speed up, scale up and scale down in the cloud. The potential of this new computation model is reflected in the introduction of serverless computing platforms by the main hyperscale cloud service providers. This paper provides an overview and multi-level feature analysis of seven enterprise serverless computing platforms. It reviews extant research on these platforms and identifies the emergence of AWS Lambda as a de facto base platform for research on enterprise serverless cloud computing. The paper concludes with a summary of avenues for further research.},

Deﬁning characteristics of the Fog are: a) Low latency and location awareness; b) Wide-spread geographical distribution; c) Mobility; d) Very large number of nodes, e) Predominant role of wireless access, f) Strong presence of streaming and real time applications, g) Heterogeneity. In this paper we argue that the above characteristics make the Fog the appropriate platform for a number of critical Internet of Things (IoT) services and applications, namely, Connected Vehicle, Smart Grid , Smart Cities, and, in general, Wireless Sensors and Actuators Networks (WSANs).},

	abstract = {The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) and the success of rich cloud services have pushed the horizon of a new computing paradigm, edge computing, which calls for processing the data at the edge of the network. Edge computing has the potential to address the concerns of response time requirement, battery life constraint, bandwidth cost saving, as well as data safety and privacy. In this paper, we introduce the deﬁnition of edge computing, followed by several case studies, ranging from cloud ofﬂoading to smart home and city, as well as collaborative edge to materialize the concept of edge computing. Finally, we present several challenges and opportunities in the ﬁeld of edge computing, and hope this paper will gain attention from the community and inspire more research in this direction.},

	abstract = {The exponential increase of the data generated by pervasive and mobile devices requires disrupting approaches for the realization of emerging mobile and IoT applications. Although cloud computing provides virtually unlimited computational resources, low-latency applications cannot aﬀord the high latencies introduced by sending and retrieving data from/to the cloud. In this scenario, edge computing appears as a promising solution by bringing computation and data near to users and devices. However, the resource-ﬁnite nature of edge servers constrains the possibility of deploying full applications on them. To cope with these problems, we propose a serverless architecture at the edge, bringing a highly scalable, intelligent and cost-eﬀective use of edge infrastructure’s resources with minimal conﬁguration and operation eﬀorts. The feasibility of our approach is shown through an augmented reality use case for mobile devices, in which we oﬄoad computation and data intensive tasks from the devices to serverless functions at the edge, outperforming the cloud alternative up to 80\% in terms of throughput and latency.},
