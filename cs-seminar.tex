\section{Introduction}
The emergence of cloud computing has been an important factor in the growing success of the Internet of Things (IoT) \cite{shi_promise_2016}.
Mainly because the cloud allows vast amounts of data to be processed efficiently \cite{shi_promise_2016}.
Something which is not attainable when processing the data directly on the IoT devices  \cite{shi_promise_2016}.
Although IoT has greatly benefited from cloud solutions is it not the silver bullet. % Sentence?
Using the cloud as the data processing backend for IoT induces several problems, like high latency and bandwidth constraints \cite{shi_edge_2016}.
One of the methods proposed to address this issue is \emph{edge computing} \cite{shi_edge_2016}.
Edge computing places computation resources close to the edge of the network\cite{shi_promise_2016}.
These computing resources are called \emph{edge devices} and potentially consist of various different types of devices, ranging from devices with low computation power, like smartphones, to computationally intense specialized micro-datacenters\cite{shi_promise_2016}.
Often is it not sufficient to merely employ edge devices, because there is no central node which has a global view of all employed edge nodes.
The necessity of a globally accessible system for all edge devices often comes from the demand for global data mining \cite{bonomi_fog_2012}.
One method of resolving this necessity is using cloud solutions.
